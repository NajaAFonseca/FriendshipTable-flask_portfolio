        <p class="text-secondary">Our project is going to be a game that we create as team. We were thinking of creating a snake game as a team.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">The program is going to be a game that users can interact with using the arrow keys as input to make the 
            snake move. The output will be the snake moving, preferably towards what the snake wants in order to grow bigger. Which leads to the 
            purpose of the snake which is to grow big and avoid hitting the walls/itself.

        <h1 class="text-primary"><strong>Purpose</strong></h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">The purpose of this project is to collaborate as a team and create a game.
            It's also to be able to learn more and see how far our skills in comp sci can currently take us. And most importantly our purpose 
            is to make a game that we think users would enjoy that is simple and fun. :)
